## üìã Description

The Face Recognition Attendance System helps you track attendance using real-time face detection. Built with Python and the face_recognition library, the system captures faces and marks attendance in a CSV file. This ensures each person's attendance is recorded only once per session, simplifying attendance management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the Face Recognition Attendance System, follow the steps below.

### üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements
